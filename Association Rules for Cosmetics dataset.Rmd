1.a Please include (copy-paste) the output ??? first fifteen rules along with header and input parameter details ??? in your submission

Reading the cosmetics dataset, which is given in matrix format. 

```{r mydata}
mydata<-read.xlsx("cosmetics.xlsx", sheetIndex = 2)
head(mydata)
```

Applying apriori algorithm on the data with a threshold support of 0.12 and confidence of 0.75 we get 19 rules, which are sorted based on the lift ratio in descending order
```{r rules}
rules = apriori(as.matrix(mydata[,2:15]), parameter=list(support=0.12, 
                                                         confidence=0.75,minlen=2)) ## the first column in mydata has transaction id
inspect(sort(rules, by="lift"))
```
Top 15 rules based on lift score
```{r Top 15 rules}
TOP15_Rules <- head(sort(rules, by="lift"),15)
#inspect(TOP15_Rules)
#is.redundant(TOP15_Rules,measure = "lift" )
 # find redundant rules
 subset.matrix <- is.subset(TOP15_Rules, TOP15_Rules)
 subset.matrix[lower.tri(subset.matrix, diag=T)] <- NA
 redundant <- colSums(subset.matrix, na.rm=T) >= 1
 #which(redundant)
 # remove redundant rules
 rules.pruned <- TOP15_Rules[!redundant]
 #inspect(rules.pruned)
#??is.redundant()
```
1b. What are the supports of the antecedent, the consequent, and the support of the rule itself for the first rule? Explain how they are calculated

The first rule from above output is
```{r first rule}
inspect(TOP15_Rules[1])
```
In the first rule we see that Brushes is the antecedent and Nail.Polish is consequent, the first rule states purchase of brush leads to  purchase of Nail.Polish
```{r count}
#number of transaction involving nail.polish and brushes
colSums(mydata[,4:5])
```
from the above output we observe that number of transaction involving Nail.Polish is 280 and
number of transaction involving brushes is 149
```{r transaction count}
nrow(mydata)
```
From the above output we observe that Total no of transactions is 1000
```{r}
Brushes_NailPolish <- mydata$Brushes + mydata$Nail.Polish
as.data.frame(table(Brushes_NailPolish))
```
From the above output we observe that in given dataset both brushes and nail polish are purchased together in 149 transactions

From the dataset we see that the support of antecedent(Brushes) is 
            = number of transaction involving brushes/ Total no of transactions
            = 149/1000 = 14.9%
            
From the dataset we see that the support of consequent(nail Polish) is
            = number of transaction involving Nail.Polish / Total no of transactions
            = 280/1000 = 28%
            
Support of Rule = Support of both Brushes and Nail.Polish together is 
            = number of transactions where both Brushes and Nail polish were purchased/ Total no of transactions
            = 149/1000 = 14.9%
            
            
1.c What is the confidence of the first rule? Explain how it is calculated.

In the first rule we see that Brushes is the antecedent and Nail.Polish is consequent.
confidence of first rule is 100%
confidence =  probability of both antecedent and consequent occuring together / probability of antecedent
here antecedent is Brushes, probability of antecedent(Brushes) = 149/1000= 0.149
probability of both antecedent(brushes) and consequent(nail.polish) occuring together = 149/1000 = 0.149
hence confidence of rule =  0.149/0.149 = 1

1d. What is the lift ratio of the first rule? Explain how it is calculated.
In the first rule we see that Brushes is the antecedent and Nail.Polish is consequent.
Lift Ratio of first rule is 3.571
In benchmark confidence we assume that the occurence of consequent in a transaction is independent of the occurence of antecedent
BenchMark confidence= (probability of both antecedent and consequent occuring together) / (probability of antecedent)

since occurence of consequent in a transaction is independent of the occurence of antecedent

probability of both antecedent and consequent occuring together = P(antecedent) * P(consequent)

BenchMark confidence = (P(antecedent) * P(consequent))/(probability of antecedent)
                    
                    = P(Consequent)
                    
Lift Ratio = confidence/Benchmark confidence

In the above(1c) answer, we have calcualted confidence. The confidence for the first rule = 1

BenchMark confidence = Probability of consequent 
                     = number of transaction involving Nail.Polish / Total no of transactions
                    = 280/1000 = 0.28
                    
  Therefore Lift Ratio = 1/0.28 = 3.571
  
1.e Reviewing the first fifteen rules, comment on their redundancy (read as constructed from same item set/tuple).
How many unique rules did you find from the first 15 rules?
```{r rules15}
inspect(TOP15_Rules)
```

  
From the above top 15 rules we observe that there is redundancy in the rules (rules consisting same itemset ) 

Rule 12 and Rule 14 are similar
Rule 11 and Rule 15 are similar
Rule 2 and Rule 5 are similar
Rule 4 and Rule 6 are similar
Rule 7 and Rule 8 are similar
Rule 3 and Rule 10 are similar

Total 6 rules are redundant , the support for the above mentioned rule pairs is similar, however there is a marginal difference in lift ratio.based on domain expertise we can decide on omitting rules 5,6,8,10,14,15 as these have correspondingly lower lift ratio

1f.Interpret the first three distinct (i.e., excluding the redundant ones, if any, as defined above) rules, in the output, in words.
The top 3 rules(based on lift ratio value) after omitting redundancies( from above 1e output)  are :

  lhs                        rhs           support confidence lift    
[1]  {Brushes}               => {Nail.Polish} 0.149   1.0000000  3.571429
[2]  {Blush,Eye.shadow}      => {Mascara}     0.169   0.9285714  2.601040
[3]  {Concealer,Eye.shadow}  => {Mascara}     0.179   0.8905473  2.494530

The first rule (Brushes,Nail.Polish) is having very high lift ratio  (3.571429) ,showing a strong association between Brushes and nail polish. 
The confidence value of 1 i.e., 100% suggests that there is a 100% likelihood of purchasing a nail polish whenever a brush is purchased by a customer.
The support value is 0.149 suggests that brushes and nail.polish are purchased together in 149 transactions out of 1000 transactions. 
All this put together a very strong association between brushes and nail.polish

The second rule ({Blush,Eye.shadow},{Mascara})  is having a lift value of 2.601040
The confidence value of 0.928 i.e. 92.8% suggests that there is a 92.8% likelihood of purchasing a mascara whenever a blush and eyeshadow are purchased by a customer.
The support value is 0.169 suggests that ({Blush,Eye.shadow},{Mascara}) are purchased together in 169 transactions out of 1000 transactions. 
Overall this suggests a strong association between ({Blush,Eye.shadow},{Mascara}) 


The third rule {Concealer,Eye.shadow}  => {Mascara}is having a lift value of 2.494530
The confidence value of 0.89 i.e., 89% suggests that there is a 89% likelihood of purchasing a mascara whenever a concealer and eyeshadow are purchased by a customer.
The support value is 0.179 suggests that ({concealer,Eye.shadow},{Mascara}) are purchased together in 179 transactions out of 1000 transactions. 
Overall this suggests a strong association between ({Blush,Eye.shadow},{Mascara}) 



1g. g) Based on the distinct rules that you identified in Part (f), suggest some action that will benefit the business owner.

if we closely inspect( Top 3 distinct Rules) we may think of bundling  Rules 2 and 3  together but such rule({Blush, concealer, eyeshadow},{Mascara}) does not come out as part of our rules as this combination does not satisfy the inital support level set by us.

From the rules 2 and 3 it can inferred that customers buying Eye Shadow can opt for multiple items to go along with it like blush, concealer, mascara whereas brush has only  one item as its consequent.

Based on this information and the financial/store space feasibility the store owner can try to make various products bundles(as suggested below) having eyeshadow as part of it thus cross selling the products. 

Possible bundles could be
Eyeshadow, Concealer ,Mascara
Eyeshadow, Blush ,Mascara
Eyeshadow, Mascara
Eyeshadow, Blush ,Concealer,Mascara
